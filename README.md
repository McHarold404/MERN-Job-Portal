# Job Portal

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application that serves as a job application portal, allowing users to search and apply for various job profiles while showcasing their skillset. The platform caters to two main user roles: Job Applicants and Recruiters.

## Technology Stack
The application is built using the MERN stack:
- React.js: Frontend framework
- Express.js: Backend framework implementing REST APIs
